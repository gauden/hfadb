# HFA Database Processor

A library to parse [WHO/Europe HFA data](http://data.euro.who.int/hfadb) from the HTML pages and provide an API for analysis and plotting.

This is a personal version with multiple dependencies and early beta code.

If you use it expect it to mangle your data irretrievably.
